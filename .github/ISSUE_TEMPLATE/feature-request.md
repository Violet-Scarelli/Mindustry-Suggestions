**Describe the content or mechanics you are proposing.**
The thruster's always been kind of... well, useless. It doesn't do anything. It is, in essence, a fancier huge scrap wall. What I was thinking was it could be redone so it works more like the firestorm wall from Tiberian Sun. It would normally be non-constructable (only available to build in sandbox mode), and when powered, generates a huge beam of energy that extends a limited distance (fifteen blocks or until it hits a wall, whichever comes first), blocking all enemy bullets/units from passing through by instantly killing them, and acting like regular enemy walls for friendly units. It would also probably need a sprite rework, and be renamed to "Shield Wall" or something. Probably look more yellow, like the shield projector.



**Describe how you think this content will improve the game. If you're proposing new content, mention how it may add more gameplay options or how it will fill a new niche.**
This could provide interesting ways to gate off areas in the campaign. For example: an area has the main objective easily accessible, but the enemy has set up an auxillary generator to power the shield-walls defending their research cache. You'll have to come back with better firepower in order to destroy the wall generators so you can steal their research. Or, you're trapped behind shield-walls with limited time before the walls are destroyed or run out of power. You can connect your network to the walls, but that only delays the inevitable... you must construct the most powerful army you can in the short time you have to fight your way out and make it to the objective. Its double-blocking ability (killing enemies and blocking friendlies) could also make it useful for air-gating areas without having to rely on huge numbers of turrets.
